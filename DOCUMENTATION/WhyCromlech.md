Why ZODB + Cromlech
=============

The ZODB gives us a persistent graph of Objects.  Cromlech
then allows us to traverse that graph, and select the appropriate
view for those objects. We can also adapt objects.  And do security on
Objects or views.  Most importantly it is not a framework, it is a toolkit.
So we only use what we want to use.
