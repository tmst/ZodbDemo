Dolmen.forms.crud Package Docs
===============

Every application needs to do CRUD on objects.  Create, Read, Update Delete.
This package provide that.  There are four classes represented here.
Display, Add, Edit, Delete, and 4 actions
AddAction, UpdateAction, DeleteAction, CancelAction

We have to define the class we are going to operating on.  But first we
have to define its interface.

You can see a working forms example here. [here](https://github.com/PythonLinks/CromlechDemo/blob/master/src/cromdemo/src/cromdemo/browser/forms.py).

Below is my draft of what CRUD.py should look like.  There
are certainly still bugs in it, but it gives you a general idea. 

```
from dolmen.forms.crud import Display, Add, Edit, Delete
from dolmen.forms.crud import AddAction, UpdateAction
from dolmen.forms.crud imnport DeleteAction, CancelAction

from cromlech.content import Factory
from cromdemo.models import Root, Leaf



@form_component
@crom.sources(IRequest, Leaf)
class AddLeafForm(Form):
   label = u"Add a Leaf"
   description = u"to the parent node."
   fields = Fields(Field(u'Name'))
   actions = Actions(AddAction("Add a Leaf",Factory(Leaf)))
```
