CROMLECH Plans
==================

This documents our plans for Cromlech Demo.

There are two classes, a container and a leaf. There are views on containers
and leafs. We want to exmpand those
make it easy to add them, and delete them.

Soon after that I will be adding in the Zopache.zmi which allows
you to manage a fodler, cut, copy paste, delete and rename items
in the folder.
