This documents our plans for Cromlech Demo.

You have to understand that this is not just a software package, it is
also a world view.  The two of us working on this have been using
such software for over 10 years now, close on 17 for me. We really
want to share this world view with others.

There are so many software projects driven by the business model. As long
as the software supports the business model all is great, we can afford
to hrie as many developers as is needed.

We take the opposite view.  The software shoudl be very flexible.  We
have powerful high level abstractions which make our work easy, simple and
fast. A single developer can get huge amounts of work done, but of us are
supporting major applications singlehandedly, indeed multiple major
applications.

How do we want the software to evolve?  In ways that make good engineering
sense.  trollfot is focussed on making the libraries better.  Christopher
is focussed on making it easy for new users to adopt.

For both of us it is very important that new users have a good experience.  We
want you to have a good time.

So how can we help you?
