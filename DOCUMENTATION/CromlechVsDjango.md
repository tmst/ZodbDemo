 The market leaders in Python web servers are Django, Pyramid and Flask.  So why not use them?

Django is for mapping a website, a tree of web pages into relational tables.
It just does not fit.  It is like having to assemble your car, everytime you take it out of the garage. Routes can be quite complex.  Usually one first gives the table name, then the object name.  Traversal leads to a much simpler URL map.

																	In contrast in the Cromlech + ZODB site map,
																	there is no need to name the tables, and a node
																	can direclty contain multiple different content types.
																	And both bloggers can post something called 'Article1'.
																	Here is what it would look like.

																															     Flask is a very stripped down web framework.  Pyramid also.  In contrast the Zope world provides a much richer vocabulary for building websites, and Cromlech does something I had not thought possible, it breaks it down into a toolkit, where the individual components can be used separately from each other.

On the ease of use side, Django is pretty good.  It has tools for bringing up applications quite easily.  Flask, I believe does not.  Pyramid has SubstanceD, but that only allows one to create content types, it is by no means a TTW Javascript IDE. Zopache makes for a much easier introduction into these tall software stacks.
