In order for an open source project to be successful,
it either needs a huge installed base, such as Linux or LibreOffice,
or it needs a business model.  While this software does not
have a huge installed base, it does have a great business model.

You are free to use this software, and do almost whatever you want
with it, but in exchange I ask you for a copy of your CV (Resume for Americans)
and permission to process your personal information for the purposes of
recruiting. Basically if you are smart enough to understand
why this software is so good, you are a very valuable developer.

Onto the specifics.  Primarily this software is subject to the Zope
PUblic License.  WHile the Zope corporation is no more, the ZPL lets you do whatever you want with the software just include their licesne, and give them credit.

I added three clauses to the ZPL. The CV License.  If you use the software, send me
a copy of your CV, and say that you give me permission to process your professional
information for recruiting purposes.  Include the CV Licesne with the distriuted software.
and give credit to Cromlech as well as Zope.
