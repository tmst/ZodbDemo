Cromlech has a very easy authentication and security model.

Before you begin traversal add an authentication decorator to the main
application.  If the person is not already authenticated it pops up forms for credentials.

Here is the authentication decorator

To protect a view, wrap it in a zope security proxy.  Before being called,
security will be checked for the authenticated users.

You can also wrap the traversal function in a security proxy.  That would
protect access to objects based on security.

Here is the security decorator.
